1. Delete the ubuntu Image.

~$ docker rmi ubuntu



2. You are required to pull a docker image which will be used to run a container later. Pull the image nginx:1.14-alpine

~$ docker pull nginx:1.14-alpine

    

3. Run a container with the nginx:1.14-alpine image and name it webapp

~$ docker run -d --name webapp nginx:1.14-alpine

   

4 Cleanup: Delete all images on the host

~$ docker rmi [image_name / image_id]

    (it will remove all image one by one)
