1)What location are the files related to the docker containers and images stored?

=> var/lib/docker

2)Run a mysql container named mysql-db using the mysql image. Set database password to db_pass123

=>docker run -d --name mysql-db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=db_pass123 mysql

3)We have just written some data into the database. To view the information we wrote, run the get-data.sh script available in the /root directory. How many customers data have been written to the database?

=> sh get-data.sh

4)Run a mysql container again, but this time map a volume to the container so that the data stored by the container is stored at /opt/data on the host.

=> docker run -v /opt/data:/var/lib/mysql -d --name mysql-db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=db_pass123 mysql

5)Disaster strikes.. again! And the database crashed again. But this time we have the data stored at /opt/data directory. Re-deploy a new mysql instance using the same options as before.

Just run the same command as before.

=>docker run -v /opt/data:/var/lib/mysql -d --name mysql-db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=db_pass123 mysql
