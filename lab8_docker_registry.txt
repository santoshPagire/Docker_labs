=>docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name my-registry registry:2

5)Now its time to push some images to our registry server. Let's push two images for now .i.e. nginx:latest and httpd:latest.

Note: Don't forget to pull them first.

=>a)docker pull nginx:latest
    docker image tag nginx:latest localhost:5000/nginx:latest
    docker push localhost:5000/nginx:latest

  b)docker pull httpd:latest 
    docker image tag httpd:latest localhost:5000/httpd:latest 
    docker push localhost:5000/httpd:latest

6)Let's remove all the dangling images we have locally. Use docker image prune -a to remove them. How many images do we have now?

=> use docker image ls command   Ans:1

7)Stop and remove the my-registry container.

=> docker stop my-registry 
   docker rm my-registry
docker pull nginx:latest then docker image tag nginx:latest localhost:5000/nginx:latest and finally push it using docker push localhost:5000/nginx:latest.
